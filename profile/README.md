## What is Student Robotics?

As a UK based charity, Student Robotics challenges teams of 16 to 18 year-olds to design, build and program fully autonomous robots to compete in our annual competition. After we announce the year's game, the teams have just six months to engineer their creations. As well as supplying teams with a kit, which they can use as a framework for their robot, we mentor the teams over this period. Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, we provide all of this to our teams at no cost.

## How can my company help?

Student Robotics is looking for new sponsors to help us fulfil our mission. The support from our sponsors makes it possible to sustain our programme and continue to run free to enter competitions that attract students from a wide range of schools and colleges. By partnering with us, you will be able to increase your organisation's or product's awareness with the next generation of engineers.

Find out more about sponsorship, on the [Sponsor page](https://studentrobotics.org/sponsor/).

## How can I help?

Student Robotics is powered by a collection of passionate individuals with varying skills from diverse backgrounds. If you're passionate about helping us achieve our goal, and you're willing to get stuck in, we have a place for you.
